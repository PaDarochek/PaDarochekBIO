# Futuristic Personal BIO Web Page Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from cyberpunk aesthetics and modern tech portfolios like those found on GitHub, Behance, and personal developer sites. The design will emphasize a sci-fi/futuristic theme with dark backgrounds and neon accents.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode Primary (Default)**:
- Background: 220 25% 8% (deep dark blue-gray)
- Surface: 220 20% 12% (elevated dark surface)
- Primary accent: 180 100% 50% (electric cyan)
- Secondary accent: 280 100% 70% (electric purple)
- Text primary: 0 0% 95% (near white)
- Text secondary: 0 0% 70% (muted gray)

**Gradients**: 
- Hero section: Subtle diagonal gradient from deep blue to purple
- Card borders: Animated cyan-to-purple gradient borders
- Button backgrounds: Cyan to purple gradient fills

### B. Typography
- **Primary**: 'Orbitron' for headings (futuristic, geometric)
- **Secondary**: 'Inter' for body text (clean, readable)
- **Accent**: 'JetBrains Mono' for technical details/code snippets

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Consistent use of 4, 8, 12, and 16 units (p-4, m-8, gap-12, etc.)
- Generous whitespace between sections
- Grid-based layout with asymmetrical elements
- Full-width hero with contained content sections

### D. Component Library

**Navigation**: Fixed top navigation with glass morphism effect and glowing active states

**Hero Section**: 
- Full viewport height with animated particle background
- Central profile image with holographic border effect
- Animated typewriter-style name and title
- Floating geometric shapes as decorative elements

**Personal Information**: 
- Card-based layout with translucent backgrounds
- Neon border accents that pulse subtly
- Icon integration using Heroicons for contact methods

**Document Downloads**: 
- Grid of document cards with hover lift effects
- Download icons with animated progress indicators
- File type badges with color coding

**Education Timeline**: 
- Vertical timeline with glowing connection lines
- Interactive nodes that expand on hover
- Animated progress bars for degree completion

**Achievements Section**: 
- Masonry grid layout for varied content types
- Article cards with thumbnail placeholders
- External link indicators with arrow icons
- Category tags with different neon colors
- Expandable descriptions on interaction

**Visual Effects**: 
- Subtle glow effects on interactive elements
- Smooth page transitions with fade/slide combinations
- Parallax scrolling for background elements
- Minimal use of particle animations for ambiance

### E. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with stacked layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Simplified animations on mobile devices
- Collapsible navigation for smaller screens

## Images
**Hero Background**: Abstract geometric pattern or particle field animation (full-width)
**Profile Image**: Circular placeholder with futuristic border treatment
**Achievement Thumbnails**: Rectangular placeholders for article/project previews
**No large hero image** - instead using animated background effects and geometric elements

## Key Interactive Elements
- Smooth scrolling navigation between sections
- Hover states with neon glow effects
- Click animations with energy ripple effects
- Subtle ambient animations to maintain engagement
